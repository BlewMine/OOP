A C++ program's memory is split into two categories: static memory and dynamic memory. 
The operating system allots static memory at startup, which contains data and programme instructions. 
The programme uses the new operator to handle dynamic memory, which is received from the operating system during execution. 
Dynamic memory's lifespan expires when the pointer that holds its address leaves the application's view, at which point the application must actively deallocate the memory by using the delete operator. 
An array of n elements can have contiguous memory allocated for it dynamically using the keyword "new" and [n], which also yields the address of the array's first element.
